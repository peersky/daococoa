## Web3 react components for Chakra on Next


React(v17) components for chakra(v1) using next(v11).

At this point this package simply can add you a navbar to the website that can select chain and keep track on it.

It will improve incrementally with focus around providing web3 functionality.

### Why not use ready wallet connect solutions
Because it tracks your activity in to 3rd party service. Not the way decentaliation wants to go.

### How to use


Either use Navbar from /components or inject a layout as following example: [\_app.tsx](https://github.com/peersky/daococoa/blob/2cd18132025772f1b8eaeff8a27e17e3c280982d/apps/bestofweb/pages/_app.tsx#L57)
