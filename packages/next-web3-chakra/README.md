## Web3 react components for Chakra on Next

At this point this package simply can add you a navbar to the website that can select chain and keep track on it. Use it if you don't want to have wallet connection on your frontend without tracking to third party as wallet connect does

Either use Navbar from /components or inject a layout as following example: [\_app.tsx](https://github.com/peersky/daococoa/blob/2cd18132025772f1b8eaeff8a27e17e3c280982d/apps/bestofweb/pages/_app.tsx#L57)
