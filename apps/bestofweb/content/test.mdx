# Milestones of Money

What the heck is Money? - If such a thought visits your head then it’s a good time for this article. Here I will lay out my understanding of how Money evolved over time and what it is today and where are we heading?

Financial systems are in a way kind a social game, where participants must agree on some authority or value of some asset. This results in the meaning of wealth and hence performing some work like mining gold becomes meaningful - it increases one’s wealth!

When combined by many participants, exciting part begins - it starts to behave as some kind of a system of liquids. Transactions can be seen as streams of liquids and many of those create currents that have volume and power. _Possession of an asset is the ability to control flow of it._

### Gold

Even before fiat money appeared, humanity used gold in what we call today a **Transaction** - transfer of some value from one holder to another in one direction, or in exchange for some goods or services.

An interesting, special case of a transaction is when someone is mining gold. In this process, one would transact some amount of gold from the environment ( _Our planet obviously can be identified as gold value holder_ ) to own possession.

Someone could question such action by saying that the environment does not really hold anything, is just there inside the earth and hence cannot be seen as a transaction.

However, we are going to look into the social impact which such action creates.

The act of mining and possession is our abstraction from generic nature law into the social dimension and economic domain and here this does create a transaction from the environment where it was locked into someone’s possession.

By possession and locking I mean that this asset now can be transferred.

Counteraction to mining would be burning gold pieces in a such a way that it returns back to no one’s possession. Imagine vaporizing gold space, or simply grinding it into dust and throwing that dust in the ocean. No one would be able to perform a transaction with that gold unless performing work to extract it from the environment again.

The gold-based economy actually has two very useful properties, which as we will see later on are not that common:

- **Equally open** - anyone can mine and possess, no one can figure out how to synthesize gold from thin air
- **Trusted** - There are many ways to validate the quality of gold and be sure that you hold a legitimate asset.

Well, why don’t we use it?

Actually we still do! Look at the gold prices! And almost in every corner of the world, you’ll find someone who is willing to negotiate with you for it. Thats another problem, that we are trying to address: **the complications of use**, or lets put it in more  modern words - **User experience (ux) of gold is bad**.

1. It’s heavy
2. Devices to validate gold are bulky
3. For large transactions it gets expensive to operate.

### Banknotes

In addressing these issues paper money (Banknotes) emerged. This revolutionary technology promised to redeem gold to one showing the banknote. This allowed to effectively abstract away from heavyweights of gold, however it came in with tradeoffs that raised the issue of openness.

By agreeing to take a promise that one can exchange banknotes back to gold, adapters of banknotes quickly lost their full freedom to freely participate in the market economy. Just because promises can be broken, and if something can happen - it will happen. **Holder of banknote became dependent on banks promise to redeem it and banks and country states were very happy to have such lever**.

From entropy law we know that such systems with participants will eventually gravitate to system-states, where participants find their optimal, less energy consuming positions. In case of banknotes, the ease of use and increasing complexity of mining gold resolved it towards losing initial association with gold and widespread adoption of banknotes.

### Fiat money

As already mentioned, systems trend to gravitate towards their optimal, less energy consuming states.

Eventually banknotes stopped to be baked by any commodity such as gold and became valueless fiat money as we know them today.

**Value of money now is justified simply by social opinion that owing much of it makes one happy**!

Nowadays no one associates his fiat money with gold reserves behind it and cannot knock on bank’s door requiring it to exchange valueless banknotes for some kind of commodity. Instead, commodities are now exchanged on a market ratio versus expectancy of happiness of having money.

Also, fiat money has a serial number, can be tracked and for security and ease of use reason trend to gravitate to central authority such as banking institutions.

### Digital banking

Internet changed things. A lot. We got payment cards, wire bank transfers.

And while it is a great journey that gave us such a tremendous kickoff for progress and worldwide trade, it also brought another big a loss of that intrinsic value of openness and trustworthiness.

Now valueless fiat papers could be stored virtually, and money issuing institutions even had no need to print anything in order to produce new value.

The state of the system became purely man-controlled (as opposed with gold where no one has the means to synthesize it out from thin air). And I’m sure there are no single institution in the world that could **exactly** tell how much fiat money is there in the world in total.

This eventually brings two problems:

1. **Stagnation of centralized economic tools** - institutions are simply not interested in taking risks to upgrade old systems that work for them and there is no competition to lose market as whole. **Nor they have any incentives to make their financial systems transparent and open**
2. **Lack of trust for a financial systems**. - Go out in street, village, country side or downtown. Ask people if they trust honesty of banking system. The author travelled many countries across the world and everywhere from a simple farmer and taxi driver up to a financial trader or scientist - trust to financial institutions and banking is very low. People use it because there is simply no better choice. But they don’t trust it and feel complexity to really participate.

### Age of Information

Mankind loves information - from gossiping about neighbours and watching stories, to reading books and educating. **We love to consume information.**

Information became extremely valuable today. Value of information also as fiat money derives from how much happier one is by having it. **Information that can make someone very happy, often is held secretly**.

Examples of such can be social connections - who is lover with who? What is someone’s salary?

And as well as fiat money, information can be very well digitalized and stored. This being utilised by the same principle of centralising and storing private data, but instead of banks, now it’s social media and search giants.

In a way it is modern gold, and _mining_ it requires someone to input it to the computerized databases. Such business already has its giant players who are in terms of their revenues sometimes larger than country states and traditional financial institutions.

Access to such information brings the ability to be ahead of competition for anyone who owns it.

Such centralisation brings in the same two problems as we saw previously -

1. **Stagnation** -, where large search and social networking giants are not seeing any risks for them that would make them lose their “gold mines” and they just keep on staying hungry on accessing more information.
2. **Lack of trust** - My impression is that people generally trend to be disappointed by how large social networking giants treat our data and what they build out of them.

But similarly, as with fiat money, we keep using what we have. Simply because existing providers enable us to exchange information with ease that humanity had not witnessed in the known past.

## The peak

Issues emerging in our digital age caught many minds that attempt to solve this problem on trust and openness. How to build something that will really work best for human mankind.

And eventually the Bitcoin white paper - long waited new revolution of pendulum. By revolution I mean here that vector of development objectives has changed drastically.

For decades and I won’t oversaturate to say - ages, from gold to digital fiat money we’ve been focusing on improving user experience and interconnecting - ease to use, speed of transactions. On the other side of medal we‘ve been sacrificing control over our data and freedom to participate in the economy.

**Now the pendulum has reached the peak value** - we have worldwide economic connections established, but they have no way of evolving in an old fashioned manner anymore.

We’ve created these worldwide connections that allow us to communicate and collaborate from any part of the world. There are still some remote frontiers left, but even now there is active development.

And we’ve fed AI with all our user data, so much, that it knows us better than we do. Yes. Take a minute of glory - **its our collective user data and input that helps to build these gorgeous AI tools**! Teaching AI - this is what happens when you’re finding traffic lights on another captcha!

## Digital revolution

This new direction is what really makes Distributed ledgers (DLTs) also named as **blockchain technology** and **web3** such a fascinating solution. Particularly those that have ability to write byte code within such as **Ethereum**.

**It’s a new paradigm we are creating here** - where anyone is enabled to not just open a shop within a few clicks. More! Where one can deploy anything within few clicks - imagine creating own currencies, own exchanges, and more importantly - create own institutions, governments, organizations, banks, social networks! All of which are functional and fully transparent!

**Web3** is about taking a step forward of fundamental freedom values such as owning your data, minding your secrets and private keys and by that becoming independent. **This is what really makes blockchain valuable** and adds intrinsic value to**.**

### Why distributed ledger systems will stay

When it comes to such topics it’s all matter of speculation with terminology and name. Should this paragraph I call blockchain, DLT, or perhaps web3? Or crypto?

The big question many adopters have is “will it stay”. Or put it other way around - If I move my funds in ETH, or other blockchain project, will I lose or win?

It’s hard and perhaps even impossible to predict the future, and I will leave this topic regarding specific projects to other people.

When arguing if it what will be with these technologies after 20 or 2000 years, (with the assumption we are not annihilating ourselves tomorrow with some nuclear war) I say that the values will certainly stay. Fundamental knowledge developed right now in crypto field defiantly will be useful in future.

Last decades clearly showed that these values of openness are important to have healthy and sustainable growth of market based economy and our civilisation as whole.

Not just because it’s right. Because eventually this open, trusted distributed ledger approach in a long run seems to be more energy efficient just because of transparency and reduction of man in the middle needed to perform actions.
