**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations** - sounds at the same time intuitively recognizable, yet so hard to exactly define.
We cannot underestimate the importance of definitions here - even on a regulatory level, SEC is breaking heads around what is definition for "sufficiently decentralized" since 2018.

By decentralization usually we assume that the system has no single point of central authority nor failure [[1]](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.80.1110). Financial regulatories add up to that an assumption there should be no actors that carry out entrepreneur or managerial efforts [[2]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418).

All of these are quite tough specifications.
Below I will seek for answers to following questions:

1. _How can we ever build a software that fits these specifications?_
2. _Can such software be ever effective at all in getting any stuff done?_

## Biosphere

_The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.” ~Richard Feynman [[3]](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/1575/1/Science.pdf)_

I suggest looking for a precedent for such a system, waiving the requirement for it to be a software for now.
If we can identify at least one - hence that task is feasible and we can study from such a system. Biosphere is a good scope to look at, since all of known to us natural organizational patterns will have biological nature.

To do so, let's first tune it - take a look at this romanesco broccoli. Isn't it amazing? An edible Fibonnaci number!

![broccoli-medium](/broccoli.webp "broccoli")

Will get to Fibonnaci numbers later. Lets first try elaborate on question:

_What common property has cabbage, human, ant, dolphin and, (arguably) Ethereum community?_

My take on this is such:
**They all consist of smaller bodies - cells, or nodes, that act as decentralized building blocks for a larger, autonomous system!**

Surprisingly, I find that if I take **any** example from Biosphere - it will carry out these properties. Even unicellular organisms with a level of desire can be broken apart to smaller building blocks that work together for a common benefit.

These organisms are incredibly decentralized in their very basis - cells work together rather by looking for a common benefit, than by having someone managing them.
There might be a control center such as the brain for larger organisms, but it does not really control internal processes well, nor has custody over an organism. And in larger creeps it eventually gets decentralized by having a spinal brain, dual cortex system etc.

To elaborate even more on the topic of the brain - we know that it’s not strictly necessary for living creatures to organize in effective structures that can get stuff done. [[4]](https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/files/papers/others/2010/tero2010a.pdf)

**What’s more interesting here to note how effective living creatures are if compared with our best takes on similar digital systems.
There is some consensus across billions of cells that allows them to work autonomously with synergy as a single unit of a higher scale life form.**

**Answering my initial questions**:

We've succeeded in identifying systems that comply with our requirements. Moreover, we found that such structures are very common in the Biosphere, and it is easy to spot how incredibly well effective living organisms are.

Hence I conclude, that our identified precedent, that we will study further, is that: _effective, decentralized and autonomous organizations can be feasible if treated as living organisms._

## Artificial organisms

_It might sound like a SciFi, but if we take a look on a facts of recent breakthrough in AI - stuff starts to get real._

Facts we know today about neuroscience (AI), certainly will become orders of magnitude more interesting when they are incorporated in autonomous and decentralized systems. It gets rather philosophical from here - are we transitioning from AI and networks into Artificial Organisms? Or saying more populistic words - are we moving towards creating **silicon based life forms**?

Given the DAOs definitions I implied in the beginning, and precedent that was found - it seems like we might even not have another way around.

Such structures should have high level of decentralized autonomy by either ability to take decisions autonomously, or by specifying a common organizational pattern - a DNA formula that pods will comply with.

Human is not excluded from such an organizational structure though, but the role now is rather more decentralized - our inputs would be validated for alignment with core definitions, or say organizational DNA in autonomous manner

Giving it even a longer look ahead, if such an AO can learn to maintain own hardware and network infrastrucute - I would say that would be a moment to say we've created a **silicon based life form**.

## Identifying patterns

We've identified some use cases where DAOs are to be seen as Artificial Organisms - that could be a way for decentralized and extremely effective systems. Now let's try to see what patterns from the Biosphere we can learn, which enable such great effectiveness?

Here are a few patterns or principles that I can identify as specifying a successful and effective organism.

### Diversity

It's worth mentioning first that we have not just one precedent. It's a whole biosphere, very diverse set, which obviously from a system level perspective is a very robust solution.
It seems that diversity should eliminate a single point of failure not just for a particular kind, but for a Biosphere in general.

We have enough software precedents for that as well. When The DAO was created many people would think that "One DAO can rule it all", however The DAO hack [[5]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)>) proved that diversity is extremely important part of decentralization

**Takeaway:**
Whatever framework(s) we are building, there must be diversity stimulated, that ensures there is no single point of failure.

### Constitution (DNA)

While Dolphins and Cabbage both share Biosphere, they are absolutely different in terms of their species, and even within species we would get different Characters.

No matter what I do in my life, I am not able to escape that fact, that I am human, not a dolphin, and that I have some special character traits that I really cannot change.

These properties I propose to combine in something that I would call a "Constitution: Organisations DNA".

**Importance of this cannot be underestimated because eventually this property has something to do with an organism being able to function effectively autonomously- _one must know who he is, and where he goes_. It is eventually some kind of consensus across all our cells - DNA that specifies on how particular cells agree to combine into a creep.**

This might seem abstract, but a recent 51% attack on Aragon DAO is a great example of someone attempting to take over the core value of being non-financial instrument [[6]](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-repurposes-dao-to-ensure-treasury-serves-its-mission/).

**Takeaway:**
Every DAO must implement some constitution that specifies how the organization positions itself. Every action must comply with it. Such an approach will allow high efficiency even in case of high uncertainties.
Ideally we want this to be some kind of a code or an AI network that is able to validate or even apply transformation to data that is being inputted.

### Nested structure

Cells unite in organs and eventually functional systems, which combine in the body and all together we can be seen by an observer combined in the biosphere.

V.Buterin actually covers that well in discussion on the fact that DAOs are not Corporations [[7]](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html) . I can refer to this diagram taken from article as a good practical example:

![buterin-nested-governance-medium](https://vitalik.ca/images/daos/pods.png "Pods")
​​
**Such Pods structure is a viable option for DAOs in case if Pods have high level autonomy, are able to receive goods and communicate with higher level core governance, which also has high level of autonomy on its own. In a shorter words - Pods must be another instance of DAO.**

**Takeway**: From what we see in Nature - Flat organizational structures are not effective. Effective DAO will have nested Governance that have their own autonomies and roles while fully reliable on vitality of higher level body.

### Interconnectivity

Ability to communicate effectively is important, this communication always somehow corresponds to the Constitution that defines not only organisms, but also the way they interact with others and distribute messages.

**Takeaway**:
There is a need for effective cross-DAO communication protocol that could stack many entities together, with every pod of an organization following some core constituion values.

### Continuous initiative activity

There is always action in life. It never stops. If brain cells stop to communicate and search for new connections - they will eventually start to malfunction. Over time the same happens in other layers.

Lack of such activity brings problems in current Governance systems with low involvement. This allows Agenda-manipulation in ranking attack, which is conducted by continuously setting up an agenda item. Attacker literally is able to get anything he wants to pass. [[6]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11341.pdf)
The only reasonable protection against such an attack would be a constant participation on initiative level from each corresponding Pod/Entity/Group member.

**Takeaway**:
We must empathize with continuous participation for every member or role in DAOs not only for voting, but also constantly keeping proposal activity. This is an essential security requirement in order for an organization to stay effective for delivering benefits for every participant.

### Adaptivity, self-recovery and security

More complex organisms generally always have a mechanism to adapt to an ever changing environment, as well as have means for self-healing and have protection systems such as membranes, immunity etc.
Vital organs often are redundant and well secured.

**Takeway**
In order to develop more complex DAOs that are viable we must ensure organizations have mechanisms to recover from any damage to their premises, implement effective security solutions and adapt to changes in the environment.
DAOs must ensure they are running on a secure premises and have redundancy in mind in cases when risks are unavoidable

### Growth

Eventually all organisms except for Unicellular grow. Staring from a cell, there is a **progressive decentralization path** when few cells eventually become a billion.

Some of these issues were covered in a recent OpenZeppelins blog post on Progressive Decentralization [[7]](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/how-web3-progressively-decentralizes-using-openzeppelin-governor)

**Takeaway**:
DAO frameworks need to have registries and factories to quickly bring-up sub-entities (Pods). There is a need for a progressive decentralization models when one can being a work and progressively split it across individuals and entities

### Common wellbeing

Eventually organisms are united together by a principles of common benefit and support. Living organisms do not spend much time for censensus agreements of untrusted enviroments, and are more reliant on incident response in form of immune system and self-repair mechanisms.

**Taekaway**:
Optimistic approach combined with well defined Constitution/DNA and strong response actions can be effective and robust solution. DAO systems must incentivise participation by giving honest participants benefits and by eliminating dishonest actors from system in most automated way possible.

## Roadmap

List above is not all inclusive. I just listed a few patterns that I see lying on the top.
If we really will go that way, than it would require need for much more competent biology researchers to collaborate with computer scientists in a same manner as today Neurobiology found its way through AI.

However even from these few patterns I can vision an approximate roadmap to go from simple Governance to true DAOs that operate as Artificial Organisms.

### 1. Centralized DAOs: Secure and active governance systems

- Capable to protect itself from attacks on main organization core values by manual, centralized action
- Secure Roles, access permission logic as well as Security systems exist
- Has high participation rate by design for both voting and agenda setting
- All of above is sufficiently diverse so that there is no single point of failure for the ecosystem

### 2. Connected DAOs: Scalable governance systems and inter-stream communication

- Nesting logic that allows effective stacking of DAOs
- Message distribution systems with constitution value validation logic in place
- Progressive decentralization is in place and scales well

### 3.AI enabled DAOs

- Core governance protocols capable to handle heavy calculations or validation of such (NNs)
- Initial AI in DAO in place works under supervised mode
- Enable learning mechanisms (continuous improvements by supervisor)
- Capable to protect itself from attacks on main organization core values in automatic mode

### 4. Artificial organisms

- AI in DAOs is sufficiently battle tested
- Supervisors removed, DAO is managed by AI
- Immutable value logic has supreme priority over AI and all other DAO primitives
- Unsupervised learning

### 5. Silicon based life forms

- Self hosted infrastructure: DAO pays for itself
- Automated factories
- Able to self-sustain with energy and material supply
- Able to self-heal by replacing hardware components
