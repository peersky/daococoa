**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations** - Term that sounds same time intuitively recognizable, yet so hard to exactly define. We cannot underestimate importance of definitions here - even on a regulatory level, SEC is breaking head around [What is definition for "sufficiently decentralized"](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) since 2018.

By decentralization usually we assume that system has no single point of custody nor failure, while financial regulatories add up to that an assumption there should be no actors that carry out enterpreneural of managerial efforts.

All of these are quite tough specifications.
Below I will seek for answers to following questions:

1. _How can we ever build a software that fits these specifications?_
2. _Can such software be ever effective at all in getting any stuff done?_

## Biosphere

_The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.‚Äù ~Richard Feynman [[The Value of Science]](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/1575/1/Science.pdf)_

I suggest to look for a precedent for such system, waiving the requirement for it to be a software for now. If we can find one - it means that task is feasible and we can study from such a system.

Knowing the fact that we are looking in to organizational systems, we can right away narrow down our observations to Biosphere scope, - only here we are able to observe organizational patterns.

To do so, lets first tune it - take a look on this romanesco broccoli. Isn't it amazing? An eadable Fibonnaci number!

![broccoli-medium](/broccoli.webp "broccoli")

Will get to Fibonnaci numbers later. Lets first try elaborate on question:

_What common property has cabbage, human, ant, dolphin and, (arguebly) Ethereum community?_

**They all consist of a smaller bodies - cells, or nodes, that act as a building blocks for a larger system!**

There are no central custody over such a "body" or, more widely - over a system. While there is some common operational protocol that holds it all together as one piece, whatever be it - cabbage or or dolphin.
If we take **any** example from Biosphere - it will actually carry out these properties. Even unicellular organisms with a level of desire can be broken apart to a smaller building blocks.

So in answering these questions, I believe we've succeeded indicating not only **decentralized** but also are very **effective** each in it own way!

Our identified precedent, that we will study further is that organizations in order to be decentralized and autonomous must behave like a living, well functioning and autonomous organisms!

## Artificial Organisms

_It might sound like a SciFi, but if we take a look on a facts of recent breaktrough in AI - stuff starts to get real._

It is hard to see any end particular point in the end there, but the facts we know today about neuroscience (AI), certainly will become order of magnitude more interesting when they are incorporated in autonomous and decentralised systems. It gets rather philosophical from here - are we transitioning from AI and networks in to Artificial Organisms? Or saying more populistic words - are we moving towards creating **silicon based life forms**?

Given the specifications we are implied, it seems like actually we will have to do.

If we are able to ensure framework that allows AI systems to be incorporated within a software that operates by principles and patterns of an living an organism, than I would say we are speaking abut **Artificial Organisms**.

This does not mean it should exclude human being from being able to impact it's decisions, however what it should mean that even without human agent inputs such system should be able to operate to some extend efficiently as an organization and for any given input it should be able to validate aligment with own mindset.

Giving it even a longer look ahead, if such an AO can learn to maintain own hardware and network infrastrucute - I would say that would be a moment to state that it is a **silicon based life-form**.

## Identifying patterns

Now we've identified that we need to build an artificial organism, we can learn from biosphere to learn any usful patterns or principles that specify an successfull and effective organism

### Diversity

It's worth to mention first that we got not just one precedent. Its a whole biosphere, very diverse set, which obviously from a system level perspective is a very robust solution.
It seems that diversity should eliminate single point of failure not just for a particular kinds, but for a Biosphere in general.

We have enough software precendents for that as well. When [The DAO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)>) was created may people would think that "One DAO can rule it all", however The DAO hack proved that diversity is extremely important part of decentralization

**Takeaway:**
Whatever framework(s) we are building, there must be diversity that ensures there is no single point of failure.

### Immutable Constitution

While Dolphins and Cabbage both share Biosphere, they are absolutely different in term of their kinds, and even within kinds we would get different Characters.

No matter what I do in my life, I am not able to escape that fact, that I am human, not a dolphin, and that I have some special character traits that I really cannot change.

These properties I propose to combine in something that I would call an "Imutable Constitution".

Impotance of this cannot be underestimated because eventually this property has something to do with organism being able to function effectively - _one must know who he is, and where he goes_. It is eventually in our DNA, the specifications on how particular cells agree to combin in to a creep.

[51% attack on Aragon DAO](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-repurposes-dao-to-ensure-treasury-serves-its-mission/) is a great example of someone attempting to take over these immutable values, that compose the very essence of an organization.

**Takeaway:**
Every DAO must implement some immutable constituion that specifies how organization positions itself. Every action must comply with it. Such approach will allow high efficiency even in case of high uncertainties.

### Nested structure

Cells unite in organs and eventually functional systems, which combine in body and all together we can be seen by an observer combined in biosphere.

[DAOs are not corporations](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html) by V.Buterin atually well covers that. And I can refer to this diagram taken from arcile as a good practicle example:

![buterin-nested-governance-medium](https://vitalik.ca/images/daos/pods.png "Pods")

**Takeway**: Flat organizational structures will not be effective. Effective DAO will have nested Governance structures that have own autonomous roles.

### Interconnectivity

Ability to communicate effectively is important, this comunication always somehow corresponds to "Immutable Constituion" that defines not only organisms, but also the way they interact with others and distrubute messages.

**Takeaway**:
There is a need for effecive cross-DAO communication protocol that could stack many entities together, and would be defined by rules establshed in entities Immutable Constitution

### Continious initiative activity

There is always action in life. It never ends. if brain cells stop to communicate and search for a new connections - they will eventually start to malfunction. Over time and same happens in other layers.

We have have good examples for this happening on governance attacks:
[Agenda-manipulation in ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11341.pdf) is a kind of attack that is concucted by continiously setting up an agenda item. Attacker literally is able to get any he wants to pass. The only reasonable protection against such an attack would be a constant participation on initiative level from each corresponding Pod/Entity/Group members.

**Takeaway**:
We must emphathisze continious participation for every member or role in DAO

### Adaptivity, self-recovery and Security

More complex organisms generally have always a mechanism to adapt for ever changing enviroment, as well as have means for self-heaking processes and have protection systems such as membranes, immunity etc.

**Takeways**
In order to develop more complex DAOs that are viable we must ensure organizations have mechanisms to recover from any damage to their premises, implement effective security solutions and adapt to changes in envioment.

### Growth

Eventually all organisms exceopt for Unicellular grow. Staring from a cell, there is a **progressive decentralization path**!

Some of these issues were covered in recent[ OpenZeppelin blog post on Progrssive Decentralization](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=openZeppelin+progrssive+decentralzation&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

**Takeaway**:
DAO frameworks need to have registries and factories to quickly bring-up sub-entities (Pods). There is a need for a progressive decentralization models when one can being a work and progressivly split it across individuals and entities

## Roadmap

List above is not exclusive, these are just a few indications that are obvious to me and indicate common pattern. From there my attempt on how roadmap from Governance to true DAOs that operate as Artifical Organisms could look like:

### 1. Build secure and active Governance systems:

First of all we must address security issues.

- Immutable value logic in place and is capable to protect from attacks on main oganization core values
- Secure Roles, access permission logic as well as Security systems exist
- Have high participation rate by design for both voting and agenda setting
- All of above is sufficiently diverse so that there is no single point of failure for the ecosystem

### 2. Build Interconnected and scalable Governance systems

- Nesting logic that allows effective stacking of DAOs
- Message distribution systems with immutable value validation logic in place
- Progressive decentralization is in place and scales well

### 3.AI DAOs

- Governance premises capable to handle heavy calculations (NNs)
- Initial AI in DAO in place works under supervised mode
- Enable learning mechanisms (continious improevments by supervisor)

### 4. Artificaial Organisms

- AI in DAOs is sufficiently battle tested
- Supervisors removed, DAO is managed by AI
- Immutable value logic has supreme priority over AI and all other DAO primitives
- Unsupervised learning

### 5. Silicon based life-forms

- Self sustainable machine factories :)
