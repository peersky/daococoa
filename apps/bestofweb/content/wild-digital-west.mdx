One key value given to us Blockchain is the openness which also comes with a price of responsibility, whether it be personal, or a responsibility for the community that trusts your technologies.

With blockchain technology getting more and more well adapted the total value locked in the projects and protocols grows, and so do the associated risks of losing one's assets.

However as we mature we will asymptotically move towards almost no hackability.

## Wild West of Digital Era

_You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig._

Zero custody, inability to easily rotate keys, lack of social protection mechanisms and reputational systems, large locked values, no control, no regulations. Sounds like a wild west, doesn't it? This fact brought in great substrate for different kinds of attacks and malicious users.

### The Good

All Safety-critical industries have strict rules and best practices developed through tragic experiences.

Thankfully, our industry is still a sandbox, not used in critical applications.

**Yes, funds can be lost, but there is no risk of trains derailing or satellites falling due to re-entrancy attack on a Solidity contract... yet. This sandbox time allows us to establish safety best practices for future adoption.**

Security companies like OpenZeppelin focus on accumulating industry expertise. Standards like EEA EthTrust aim to become safety benchmarks and we all are learning diligently from every security incident out there.

**Also good to note, that one reason for numerous hacks in the blockchain space is the transparency of DLTs. Hacks cannot be easily hidden, unlike in Web2 where breaches can go undisclosed. The extent of hacks in Web2 remains unknown.**

### The Bad

Security is an ongoing concern. Despite implementing multiple layers of safety, there will always be a probability of things going wrong. Cryptographic security assumptions are inherently probabilistic, meaning there will never be a point where we can relax and claim 100% security.

**The solution is to adopt a continuous security-first approach throughout every step of the project lifecycle, similar to safety-critical industries. Security monitoring, threat modeling and incident response post deploy are a must in the same manner as automotive industry implies safety switches and feedback loops to ensure reliability of vehicles in operation.**

While every entrepreneur would want to have this 100% security point, it's not the case in other safety critical industries. Despites all efforts even today trails occasionally derail, and that's despite all of the security measures in place. So far there is no evidence to assume any difference will apply to blockchain space.

### The Ugly

Unfortunately there is no magic solution that fits all. Blockchain comes in with its implications, especially on a personal individual responsibility. Account Abstraction and Social Recovery might soften that responsibility over time, but the Private Keys security will stay more actual than ever before.

The only long term lasting solution we can see is gradually moving towards AA and social recovery, while at the same time enhancing the culture of private keys storage by educating users and especially those who are power users.

## Footnote

Security companies are essential players of the industry who put all of their efforts on the security aspect of applications.
These companies form a united ecosystem that collaborates to create reliable and secure frameworks, codebase, as well as post-deployment measures.

Eventually we are moving towards rock-solid industry standards and well defined interoperability.

**As times goes on and as projects mature, the frameworks for security will emerge. Moreover, the benefit of hacking protocol or project will diminish as more and more projects will imply incident response models that will yield attackers either blacklisted to the blockchain community or totally busted. The main challenge for us here is not to get over excited and keep a well noted memory of values of Open Economy that we should not lose again.**
