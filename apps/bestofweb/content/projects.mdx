[rankify.it](https://rankify.it) is a novel re-imagination of how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations can vote and propose agendas. By running continuous voting-proposing cycles within one round, it creates ranked lists of ideas according to what a pod (group of friends) likes and ranks participants according to their competence in feeling group preferences on a subject. The continuity of the process ensures that participants have enough time to learn about the tastes of their group and adapt their proposals accordingly.

This project is aimed to solve multiple current DAO problems, such as:

- **Competence-based authority** - A user's rank can be used as another voting power dimension for traditional DAO voting systems. This can be used to give competent users a higher voting power over those with lower proven competence levels.
- **Cross-stream collaboration** - User rank can be shared across organizations and work groups, therefore it can act as autonomous proof of one's competence.
- **Low participation rates** - In this approach, the process itself is very creative, feels less intimidating for participants, and can potentially be profitable as disciplines can be tokenized as transferable assets.
- **Security risks** - Top winning list items used as agenda items allow addressing agenda-manipulation attacks.
