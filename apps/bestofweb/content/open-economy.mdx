# Open Economy

![Pond](/pond.png "Pond")

_I believe every human in our society should have equally open access for fair use of trusted economic tools and resources such as: ability to freely trade, borrow, invest, crowdfund, manage and own assets. Without look on which country, religion, geographic location, sex or whatever else else person identified himself as as well as means to verify and trust these tools._

Statement above I find is not a desire or wish, but rather a nessesity which is unavoidable requirement for a having a healthy society without which no real innovation nor progress is really possible. To be more specific, two properties must be present in economy. It must be:

- **Equally open** - meaning that anyone can participate
- **Trusted** - meaning that there are ways to validate tools and values.

## Problem

If we take look on historical perspective, we will clearly see that over centuries worldwide civilization slowly progressed from having these two properties in to a stagnant state of end of 20th Century where these properties got absolutely lost.

So how did we get here?

**Gold based economy** - This is what was appears to be historical ancestor for what we have today.

And if we take a look on these properties in context of Gold based economy - we get these these values out of the box!

- **Equally open** - anyone can mine and possess, no one can figure out how to synthesize gold from thin air
- **Trusted** - There are many ways to validate the quality of gold and be sure that you hold a legitimate asset.

**Banknotes** - This revolutionary technology promised to redeem gold to one showing the banknote. This allowed to effectively abstract away from heavyweights of gold!

However a small problem here. Banknotes could be issued and redeemed only by a centralized authority - such as bank or govermental institution. Meaning that they could refuse to redeem, or issue banknotes in quantity larger than underlying asset.

Technically, still it is a gold based economy we are talking, so one could still be participant with full openness benefits by utilizing gold and not using banknotes.

**Fiat money** - Value of money now is justified simply by social opinion that owing much of it makes one happy!

Eventually banknotes stopped to be baked by any commodity such as gold and became valueless fiat money as we know them today. Meaning that for sake of better user experience, two previously mentioned properties got sacrificed.

Have you ever thought what makes fiat money valuable at all?

According to [Lagos, Ricardo & Wright, Randall (2005). "A Unified Framework for Monetary Theory and Policy Analysis". Journal of Political Economy. 113 (3): 463–84](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/429804) fiat money has no intrinstic value! The Value is created purely by community and, at equillibrium makes trades possible.

**Digital banking** - big bold cross put on of openness and truthworthiness. Yet feels so nice!

Now valueless fiat papers could be stored virtually, and money issuing institutions even had no need to print anything in order to produce new value. If fiat money could at least be somehow tracked, how do you track a bytes and pixels in a systems that were designed under closed doors?

![uncrtainty](/uncertaincy.webp "Uncertaincy")

The state of the system became purely man-controlled (as opposed with gold where no one has the means to synthesize it out from thin air). And I’m sure there are no single institution in the world that could **exactly** tell how much fiat money is there in the world in total.

### But why is loss of these values a problem?

We live in capitalizm, which relies idealogically on idea that [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) is able to solve problems. However in order for such to happen, there should be fair competition, which is not possible if you have people leaving the market because they either do not trust it, or becuase they are not able to join it.

Stagnation eventually is what we see in traditional banking system and Fiat based finance markets which did not change a lot since their invention.

## Distributed revolution - as a solution

Eventually when questioned about intrinsic value of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, or Ethereum - first and second are these two properties:

- Due to distributed-ledger approach, anyone is able to verify and validate records, hence trust!
- Due to reliance on cryptographic proofs and consensus mechanisms, it's generally much more open to open interaction by anyone, even thought there are still room for improvements.

Bringing back old good values is what really makes Distributed ledgers (DLTs) such a fascinating solution.

And you can feel how much innovative this is. Just think about paradigm we are creating - where anyone is enabled to deploy whole banking systems, exchanges and governance strucutres just in a few clicks!

We are creating generalized approach to write not just a money, but a contracts in a medium that can be trusted and verified by anyone.

The impact of these changes is going to be massive, and it still is hard to predict how it plays out in the future - but what we can make sure that this is definitely a breaktrough financiai technology

This is reason why I'm excited to be part of [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) as our mission is protect values of Open Economy which are so important to make world a better place.
