**_"Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow."_**

Just a short essay, summary of my inner work, research to understand where from monetary system of today originated and what are latest advances.

### Etymology

The word Money itself originates from Latin - Goddess Juno Moneta was the protectress of funds, and accordingly money in ancient Rome was coined in her temple. This fact brought us terms "[money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Juno_Moneta)" and "[mint](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility)>)"
![Juno Moneta](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Juno_Sospita_Statue.jpg/1920px-Juno_Sospita_Statue.jpg "Goddess of Money")

Therefore something sacred is in the topic from the very beginning. Perhaps this can explain why some people treat money as if it is god!

### Understanding wealth

We all are taught in school, that money is a way to abstract from a barter trade and create common exchange medium for the goods. However, how do we define in this context a personal **wealth**?

According to a German philosopher Georg Simmel, who addressed same question in his book "[Philisophy of Money](http://www.eddiejackson.net/web_documents/Philosophy%20of%20Money.pdf)" in year 1900 -

**_"Money payment as the form most congruent with personal freedom"_**

Georg Simmel viewed the question from a social angle.

Recent studies have gone way deeper than that. By viewing financial systems as essentially weave equations, simialar to electronics excitations of discrete-time spectrum signal, researchers expand boundaries in to [**quantum** economic theory](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/65442/1/MPRA_paper_65442.pdf)

As a guy who loves signal processing and [Furier transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) I find this definition extremely fascinating!

If we start thinking of finances as a waves, than we should be able to bring same wave properties as any signal should have: Power, Energy, Vector(direction), Source and Load Resistances, Load matching and eventually Resonances.

Giving all of such definitions perhaps would be a good challenge for a Thesis. Some simple thoughts on that:

If we say that one monetary unit (let say one [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp)) is an equivalent of a one charge carrier particle (electron) in electric signal domain, hence we can say that **wei is a financial charge carrier** this alone will automatically result in definitions of Financial power, energy, potential, etc in a similar manner as it is defined in Physics.

I am able to redefine one's wealth from Simmels to more abstract, wave-ish narrative:

**Finacial Wealth** - Degree of how much financial energy can one arbitary apply in the medium.

That said, it still has very similar to Simmels descripton as personal freedom assumes being able to do something. However this definition gives slightly wider definition, since it does not ties to a money as tool.

### Gold

Even before fiat money appeared, humanity used gold in what we call today a **Transaction** - transfer of some value from one holder to another in one direction, or in exchange for some goods or services.

The gold-based economy actually has two very useful properties:

- **Equally open** - anyone can mine and possess, no one can figure out how to synthesize gold from thin air
- **Trusted** - There are many ways to validate the quality of gold and be sure that you hold a legitimate asset.

Almost in every corner of the world, you’ll find someone who is willing to negotiate with you for it. Thats another problem, that we are trying to address: **the complications of use**, or lets put it in more  modern words - **User experience (ux) of gold just sucks:**

1. It’s heavy
2. Devices to validate gold are bulky
3. For large transactions it gets expensive to operate.

### Banknotes

In addressing these issues paper money (Banknotes) emerged. This revolutionary technology promised to redeem gold to one showing the banknote. This allowed to effectively abstract away from heavyweights of gold, however it came in with tradeoffs that raised the issue of openness.

By agreeing to take a promise that one can exchange banknotes back to gold, adapters of banknotes quickly lost their full freedom to freely participate in the market economy. Just because promises can be broken, and if something can happen - it will happen. **Holder of banknote became dependent on banks promise to redeem it and banks and country states were very happy to have such lever**.

From entropy law we know that such systems with participants will eventually gravitate to system-states, where participants find their optimal, less energy consuming positions. In case of banknotes, the ease of use and increasing complexity of mining gold resolved it towards losing initial association with gold and widespread adoption of banknotes.

### Fiat money

As already mentioned, systems trend to gravitate towards their optimal, less energy consuming states.

Eventually banknotes stopped to be baked by any commodity such as gold and became valueless fiat money as we know them today.

**Value of money now is justified simply by social opinion that owing much of it makes one happy**!

Nowadays no one associates his fiat money with gold reserves behind it and cannot knock on bank’s door requiring it to exchange valueless banknotes for some kind of commodity. Instead, commodities are now exchanged on a market ratio versus expectancy of happiness of having money.

Also, fiat money has a serial number, can be tracked and for security and ease of use reason trend to gravitate to central authority such as banking institutions.

### Digital banking

Internet changed things. A lot. We got payment cards, wire bank transfers.

And while it is a great journey that gave us such a tremendous kickoff for progress and worldwide trade, it also brought another big a loss of that intrinsic value of openness and trustworthiness.

Now valueless fiat papers could be stored virtually, and money issuing institutions even had no need to print anything in order to produce new value.

The state of the system became purely man-controlled (as opposed with gold where no one has the means to synthesize it out from thin air). And I’m sure there are no single institution in the world that could **exactly** tell how much fiat money is there in the world in total.

This eventually brings two problems:

1. **Stagnation of centralized economic tools** - institutions are simply not interested in taking risks to upgrade old systems that work for them and there is no competition to lose market as whole.
   Nor they have any incentives to make their financial systems transparent and open
2. **Lack of trust for a financial systems**. - Trust to financial institutions and banking in casual conversation appears is very low. People use it because there is simply no better choice. But they don’t trust it and feel complexity to really participate.

## The stale point

As you already can see from previous points - there are problems of trust and openmidness in monetary system.

Eventually they bring us to point where further evolution of road with the same wheelbase just makes no sense. It works. works great! But over past 60 years it's there is not been any significant financial bereakthroughs!

Issues emerging in our digital age caught many minds that attempt to solve this problem on trust and openness. How to build something that will really work best for human mankind.

And eventually the Bitcoin white paper - long waited breaktrough!

For decades and I won’t oversaturate to say - ages, from gold to digital fiat money we’ve been focusing on improving user experience and interconnecting - ease to use, speed of transactions.

We’ve created these worldwide connections that allow us to communicate and collaborate from any part of the world. There are still some remote frontiers left, but even now there is active development.

And we’ve fed AI with all our user data, so much, that it knows us better than we do. Yes. Take a minute of glory - **its our collective user data and input that helps to build these gorgeous AI tools**! Teaching AI - this is what happens when you’re finding traffic lights on another captcha!
