Public onchain two way lookup between a registred blockchain address and user on some particular domain.

## Definitions

`domain` - some identificaiton of a particular domain name or app name that hosts his user base (I.E. cna be `Discord.com`)
`registrar` - on each `domain` there is required to be at least one signer that is able to validate user data and approve their registration by signing it.
`user id` - immutable identifier of any user on a particular domain
`user name` - human readable user identifier

## Features

- Any address can be linked to any number of domains, and looked up in both directioins - "address to id@domain" and "id@domain to address", hence makes possible to lookup user at one domain at another domain (i.e. "find user_id@domainA at domainB" usecase is possible)

- Makes it possible to execute transactions in social media chats by addressing users by their name (i.e. /send 1eth `@<username>`)

## ENS

This is not implemented at the moment, however the idea is that multipass can be integrared in ENS as resolver contract.
